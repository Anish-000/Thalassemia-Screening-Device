# Thalassemia-Screening-Device
My First Official Work for developing a screening device named " Thalassemia Screening Device " using Arduino Uno

Thalassemia Screening Device


Overview


This project is a Thalassemia Screening Device developed using Arduino Uno, Jumper Wires, LCD Display, 4x4 Keyboard, and Breadboard. The device is designed to assist in the initial screening process for Thalassemia by measuring certain input parameters and providing a preliminary diagnosis.


Components Used


Arduino Uno - The main microcontroller used for processing input and controlling the device.

LCD Display - Used to display messages, instructions, and results.

4x4 Keyboard - Provides a simple interface for data entry.

Breadboard - Used for prototyping and making connections.

Jumper Wires - For establishing connections between components.


Features


User-friendly interface using a 4x4 Keyboard.

Clear output display via the LCD screen.

Real-time processing and feedback.

Modular and easy-to-replicate hardware setup.


Applications


Thalassemia screening in rural or low-resource settings.

Educational purposes for learning about Arduino and medical electronics.
